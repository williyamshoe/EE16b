All you need to do now is to put everything together in a single Launchpad program. The objective is to get SIXT33N to move straight, turn left, go straight for a shorter distance, and turn right when it hears the corresponding command.\n",

    "\n",

Try reducing your SNIPPET_SIZE (window length) so your vectors aren't quite as long. This may change your classification, but hopefully for the better. It's ok if you get a warning about *low* memory."

If you forgot the pins you should attach to the motors and encoders, you can find them in the define statements in the top of the Launchpad sketch. If your car doesn't have as much drive as before, you might need to change to fresh batteries - check the voltage of your battery using the Digital Multimeter and if it is considerably less than 9V ask for fresh ones.\n",

    "- Set SIXT33N on the ground, then say the commands one-by-one. You should at least say each command twice, in any order you'd like.\n",
    "- It's helpful for you to say what the word you are about to say is supposed to do.\n",
    "    - It's hard for us to memorize all 4 of your commands up front.\n",

    "#### Live Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "- During the live demo, you will demo your SIXT33N in person.\n",
    "- Live demos can be done during regular lab time, which is until **Tuesday, December 4th at 8:00 PM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Video Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing a live demo, you can also record a video of your project and upload it to YouTube.\n",
    "- The video has to include the members' faces. Start by introducing your group, and explain the commands you will use.\n",
    "- The video cannot be edited or sliced - the demo should be continuous.\n",
    "- Again, it's helpful for you to say what the word you are about to say is supposed to do.\n",
    "    - It's hard for us to memorize all 4 of your commands up front.\n",

    "- Video submissions must be received by **Tuesday, December 4th at 11:59 PM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/fa18/lab/proj_deliverables.pdf) for more detailed instructions for your demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write-up\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the demo, you will need to submit a write-up of the project. In about 2 pages, briefly summarize each phase of your project and elaborate on your design choices. Submit the write-up as a PDF to Gradescope by **Thursday, December 6th at 11:59 PM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The write-up should include these topics:\n",
    "- Front-end circuit\n",
    "- PCA classification\n",
    "- Control\n",
    "- General\n",
    "- If you did a video checkoff, include a link to your video.\n",
